                "\nThe city of Hong Kong is always busy, millions of people trying to rush to somewhere. It tires you sometimes. You don't know why, but you've been feeling " +

                "\nyour legs aren’t shaking, and start walking away with quick steps. You try not to look back as you get out of the tea house and make your way out of the " +
                "\nbackstreet. It is hard to hold yourself, but you manage to walk away without looking back. Until, you hear heavy footsteps.\n" + "Is it that man?\n" +
                "You gulp down the knot in the middle of your throat, slowing down for a second to listen, making sure that you heard it right.\n" + "The footsteps get " +
                "\nclearer, closer. \n" + "You finally gather enough courage to turn to your back.\n" + "The street is empty.\n" + "A sigh of relief escapes your lips, your " +
                "\nheart still hammering inside your chest. You shake your head, turning again and continuing, walking so fast that you are almost running. After a quick " +
                "\nwalk to your house which was full of fear and paranoia, you fumble around in your pocket to find your keys, opening the door and entering. You close the " +
                "\ndoor a little too harshly, hoping that no one in the apartment heard you do that. Your tired legs carry you to your flat on the fourteenth floor. \n" +
                "Once you get inside, locking the door and closing all the windows are the first things you do. You take off your shoes and jacket, sighing after throwing yourself on the couch.\n" +

                "\nhim clearly?\n" + "You couldn’t have been dreaming.\n" + "Right?\n" + "You groan, rubbing your eyes and temples to save yourself from the headache, even " +
                "\nfor a bit. If your coworkers hear this, they will laugh at your face and tell you that you are going insane.\n" + "Maybe you really are.\n" +
                "You change your clothes and prepare dinner; instant noodles. You put your cat’s meal as well, with some water on the side. She meows and accepts a soft pat " +

                "\nHopefully you will not be murdered pathetically in your sleep.\n" + "With a heavy headache, you lie down on your bed. Sleep doesn’t come easy to you, " +

                "\n You open it to see what it is, and find a gray, thin stick almost the length of your briefcase. There is a note attached to it and it writes, just like \n" +

                "You frown, leaving the note on the floor and examining the stick. So, is this the piece of aluminium?\n" + "How was the person able to find such thing and " +
                "\nput it in your briefcase without you knowing it?\n" + "This gets scarier with every moment.\n" + "You decide to keep the stick in your briefcase and leave " +
